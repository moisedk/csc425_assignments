Question 2: Runing "$free --mega" gives me  this, which I expect because there are 16GB memory available in the computer (roughly 16 000 megabytes)
About 7GB has been used, and 4.5GB are free; Most of the number make sense to me, except the cache/buffer which is a little too high

               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           16492        6833        4473         661        6197        9658
Swap:              0           0           0

(I ran this on my own computer, not the server because I did not know what to expect)

Question 4: The size of the use memory increased after I started the program; When I incrased the number of memory to 10MB for an array, 
I received a segmentation fault; After killing the program, the free memory increased. This was expected;
Question 6: I used one process to fork two children and used getpid() to get their IDs. Please see dumb_ids.c which is the program that I used
Question 7: What do I see? ==> A table with different columns which I suppose represent properties of the memory of the process whose id I passed to 'pmap'
            Columns include Address, Perm, Device, Inode, etc, most of which don't make sense to me.
            In addition to the stack, there are other memory spaces like 'anonymous' or 'kernelPageSize' which don't look familier
            I cannot precisely distinguish between what is the heap/code from the output of 'pmap --XX pid'. 
Question 8: The stack size grow almost proportionally to the memory size that I passed to 'memory-user'
            stack_size      memory-user argument
            992             1
            4892            5
            6848            7
